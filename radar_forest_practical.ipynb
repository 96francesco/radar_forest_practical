        "The study area is located in Central Guyana (South America). Guyana is widely covered by tropical rain forest and is considered as one of the cloudiest countries in the world characterized by a very high mean annual cloud cover of > 80%. The study area extends approximately 20 x 15 km (5°20’ N; 58°59’ W) and is part of the main mining district: Mahdia. Around Mahdia, deforestation rates are high. The main driver of deforestation is small- and medium-scale alluvial open pit gold mining (Clifford 2011; Pöyry Management Consulting (NZ) Limited 2011) ([Figure 1](https://github.com/96francesco/radar_forest_practical/blob/main/images/fig1.png)). First the forest is removed, followed by gold mining activities with ‘land dredging’ being the commonly practiced mining method (Clifford 2011). Throughout the last decade, gold mining increased rapidly in Guyana and accounts for 46% of the total export earnings in 2011 (Guyana Bureau of Statistics 2012)."

        "The Japanese ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) PALSAR (Phased Array L-band SAR) was operating between 2006 and 2011 and is the first SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) mission with global systematic acquisition strategy. The data stream is continued by ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 (since 2014). SAR penetrates through clouds and can operate day and night, both major advantages over optical satellite data when monitoring tropical forest. Because of its long wavelength (23.6 cm), PALSAR penetrates the forest canopy and backscattering is primarily caused by branches and trunks. Double-bounce scattering in particular, where the SAR signal fully penetrates the canopy and is scattered back by the ground and trunks, results in high L-band SAR backscatter. After deforestation, the L-band backscatter strongly decreases causing a larger contrast between forest and non-forest. ALOS PALSAR images are acquired in three basic image modes at medium spatial resolution (you can check it [here](https://github.com/96francesco/radar_forest_practical/blob/main/images/tab1.png)).\n",

        "**Question 7**: Which scatter mechanism(s) cause the high HV backscatter over forest (F) when compared to non-forest (NF) areas? Briefly explain the mechanism(s).\n",

        "**Question 8**: What causes the increase in HH backscatter over inundated forest areas when compared to non-inundated (non-flooded) forest? It’s helpful to make a sketch including the side-looking radar. Hint: Both surface roughness and scatter mechanism play a crucial role.\n",

        "**Extra question II**: The analysis was done using L-band SAR images acquired by ALSO PALSAR (23.6 cm wavelength). How would the separability of forest and non-forest change for a C-band SAR image (e.g. Sentinel-1) considering its shorter wavelength (5.3 cm wavelength). Do you expect the separability to be better or worse? Explain!"
